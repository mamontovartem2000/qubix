=====================
Demo Scene
=====================
This scene contains all the code  and assets I used in the construction of the webplayer demo.As I am not really a programmer, and rather more of an artist, and because this package is focussing more upon the
particle effects and animated sprite textures all this code is provided "as-is".  That said if you have any questions shoot them my way and I'll do my best to answer them.
